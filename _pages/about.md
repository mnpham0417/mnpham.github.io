About me
------
Hi, I am an incoming Ph.D student at New York University, under the supervision of <a href="https://chinmayhegde.github.io/">Prof. Chinmay Hegde</a>. I graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~jrwhitehill/">Prof. Jacob Whitehill</a>. My primary research areas are domain adaptation, few-shot learning, and speaker verification.
